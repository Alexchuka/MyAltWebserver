Step 8: Uploaded my HTML File from my Local Computer to my AWS Ubuntu server using SCP following the steps below:

1. Used the Syntax: `scp -i /path/to/your-key.pem /path/to/local-file.html ubuntu@<server-ip>:/path/to/destination/`

2. Edited the Synax on my computer: `scp -i ~/Documents/Altschool\ Training/linux/AltKey.pem ~/Documents/Altschool\ Training/linux/index.html ubuntu@18.175.111.255:/var/www/html/`

I got the error messages: 
	`scp: dest open "/var/www/html/index.html": Permission denied
	 scp: failed to upload file /Users/chukanwachukwu/Documents/Altschool Training/linux/index.html to /var/www/html/`
Needed to allow permissions to the Ubuntu user as it only allowed the root user.

3. Logged on to my server: `ssh -i AltKey.pem ubuntu@18.175.111.255`

4. Ran the commands to check and allow permission:
`ls -ld /var/www/html/
sudo chown -R ubuntu:www-data /var/www/html/
sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html/`

6. Ran the upload file again 
`scp -i ~/Documents/Altschool\ Training/linux/AltKey.pem ~/Documents/Altschool\ Training/linux/index.html ubuntu@18.175.111.255:/var/www/html/`

<img width="1224" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc15f337-15ab-4a80-b47e-56022ad62997" />

It Worked!

Step 9: Edit the HTML file with the command:
`Sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html`

<img width="1227" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30a164b6-4e92-4f24-8d2d-dee98c40553f" />

Used `Control + X` to exit.
The page was successfully deployed to http://18.175.111.255/

Step 10:  Configured HTTPS for my web server following the below steps:

1. Installed Certbot for Apache with the command:
  `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache`

3. Obtain and install Certificate using the command:
   `sudo certbot --apache`

Couldn't continue because I did not have a domain name, need to get one. 

3. I activated my domain `chuhubspace.com` hosted on Azure and created a host `A` record with my IP Address `18.175.111.255`

Ran the command `sudo certbot --apache` and we successfully enabled HTTPS on my domain.
